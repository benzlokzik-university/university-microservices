# Project description

- This is a microservice architecture university project
- Each service is a separate project stored in the `code/services` directory
- Each service has its own `pyproject.toml` file
- Each service has its own `tests` directory
- Instead of editing README.md files, you should edit the `report.typ` file (ask for which file to edit)
